        Born in 1996, Music has always been a part of my life. At an early age I
        would keep rhythm with the music I would hear on the radio or even hum
        to the tune. Tapping along to the beat or singing along or even making
        strange sounds with different instruments or pots and pans always was
        the center of attention to me. Other kids wanted to grow up to be a
        lawyer or doctor, but I knew I wanted to be a musician. After Highschool
        I packed all my things from my hometown of Bryan, Texas and moved to
        Auburn, Alabama trying to search for some sort of Independence and
        freedom from something

        As the year went by, 2015 quickly turned into 2016 and I had still no
        since of direction. Yes music was my passion, but I had no idea on how I
        would fit in. I haven’t played any instruments to learn over years of
        practice, and the guitars I did have, I would only strum. As the end of
        the summer approached, I decided that maybe making the move wasn’t such
        a good idea after all. I found a full-time job at Lowes in order to save
        up for the move back. As I began to meet more and more coworkers, I had
        met an up and coming country artist, Ben Myrick. We became friends and
        he shared his side gigs with me intriguing me more into the music scene.
        He would perform during Auburn football game days, bars, open mics
        around Auburn and at his fraternity. He sometimes would ask if I would
        like to come along to help set up some of the time. It did not matter to
        me if I was the performer or not, I loved to be around music. One of the
        most memorable times was one bar in particular. Mo’s Irish Pub in
        Huntsville, Alabama. This is where I really got to set up stage and mic
        things up and prepare for the live show. And at that moment I really
        found a place in music and felt that I really fit in. He and I worked
        together making the experience for me not only fun, but enjoyable.

        After the move back to Texas, the people that I thought were my friends
        at the time used me as I was blind to what they did behind my back. I
        fell into a rough depression that eventually lead me to being homeless.
        Sometimes I would ask some acquaintances to couch surf with but deep
        down inside I knew that this was not right. I needed to make a change.
        During 2017 I met a friend at a party, and the rest was history. She
        took me in and gave me a place to stay rent free with her and her two
        other roommates. We all became friends through common interests and soon
        after she ended up being a coworker of mine. What was friends at first
        quickly stemmed into feelings, and after her move back to her home town
        I asked her to be my girlfriend. Leaving me behind she moved back to her
        home town in Houston, Texas and I was left in College Station alone,
        once again. Keeping a long-distance relationship, the year couldn’t have
        gone any faster. I found a well-paying job at a local golf course as a
        ground’s keeper. This helped in many ways taking me off the streets of
        Bryan, and finally renting my first apartment and purchasing my first
        car. I was thankful of the many blessings I had received in such a short
        time. I finally had a roof over my head, a room and my own bed!

        2017 turned to 2018 and by July my Lease was up. As my girlfriend and I
        talked about my next steps, her family offered me a place to stay In
        Houston with them on one condition, I must go to school and get a
        degree. This motivation now is like no other. Being out of school for at
        least three years I wasn’t sure how I would fit in. I looked over my
        options and realized I had no other paths left. I must do this for me
        and my future. As of 2018 to present, I am a fulltime student at the
        Houston Community College and studying Audio Engineering and Production.
        The experience’s I have had are amazing, meeting more and more people
        that relate to me and networking with other artists and producers in my
        class and in the program.

        I know that I have a long road ahead, with many obstacles in my way. But
        I am prepared for a long lasting, resilient journey.
